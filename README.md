# SimCCL

SimCCL is an important component of [**SimAI**](https://github.com/aliyun/SimAI), which enables the transformation of collective communication operations into point-to-point communications. 

A basic version (files prefixed with mocknccl) is currently available in the [**astra-sim-alibabacloud**](https://github.com/aliyun/SimAI/tree/master/astra-sim-alibabacloud) repository.
The complete version will be separately included in this repository within the next two weeks.
